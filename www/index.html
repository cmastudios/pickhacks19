      <h1>About FLEX</h1>
      <p>When a sports injury happens, the most important thing is the path to
        recovery. Tracking progress towards recovery is crucial to determine
        when an athlete can play again. That’s what inspired FLEX: a device,
        app, and website designed to help athletes and their physicians on the
        road to recovery. Using the FLEX device, athletes can measure range of
        motion (ROM) in their affected limbs daily, without going to a physical
        therapist to perform basic exercises. FLEX interprets data from the
        FLEX device and suggests exercises to improve ROM in affected areas,
        and patients can send their therapists information about their
        progress to better develop a plan.</p>
        <p>Beyond the world of athletic injuries, FLEX can make positive change
        for anyone who wants to improve their flexibility.
        From new dancers and gymnasts to those affected by arthritis,
        surgeries, and joint pain, FLEX can guide anyone on the path to
        increased range of motion.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Any exercise recommendations are based on FLEX’s interpretation
        of range-of-motion data, not the recommendation of a medical
        professional. Always follow instructions from your doctor or physical
        therapist.</p>
