      <h1>Arm Raise</h1>
      <p>This stretch will increase the range of motion in your shoulder. To do
        this stretch, first attach the FLEX to your upper arm with the screen
        facing outward, begin the Arm Raise stretch in your FLEX app, then hold
        your arms at your sides. Slowly raise your arm sideways until it
        becomes slightly uncomfortable to hold up, maintain the stretch for 1
        second, then slowly lower the arm back to your side. Repeat for the
        amount of time the app allots.</p>

      <h1>Hip Rotator Stretch</h1>
      <p>This stretch will increase the range of motion in your outer hip,
        where the leg rotates inside the joint. To do this stretch, first
        attach the FLEX to your thigh with the screen facing upward and lie
        down with both feet on the floor. Begin the Hip Rotator stretch in your
        FLEX app, then place your head back on the floor. Slowly pull your knee
        outwards, being careful not to straighten your leg, until it becomes
        slightly uncomfortable to hold out. Maintain the stretch for 3 seconds,
        then slowly move your knee back to the middle. Repeat for the amount of
        time the app allots.</p>

      <h1>Toe Touch</h1>
      <p>This stretch will increase the range of motion where your back meets
        your hips. To do this stretch, first attach the FLEX around your waist
        with the screen facing backwards and stand straight with your feet
        shoulder width apart. Begin the Toe Touch stretch in your FLEX app.
        Slowly reach towards your knees, being careful not to bend your knees
        or lean your hips forward or backward, until it becomes slightly
        uncomfortable. Maintain the stretch for 3 seconds, then slowly raise
        back up to a standing position. Repeat for the amount of time the app
        allots.</p>
